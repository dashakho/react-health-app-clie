## Application Description
FindDoctor is a single-page application which allows users to search for doctors. Once signed up and authenticated, users can:
1. Create their own collection of doctors, update and delite them;
2. Search for doctors from a third-party API belonging to [NPPES NPI Registry] (https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/);
3. Search for hospitals via Google Maps;

The backend was built using Express.js and MongoDB. The front-end was built using React.js and Axios for http requests (the requests communicate with the back end and third-party API). -->

## Thought Process & Execution

* Planning: Initially I planned out the user stories and wireframes to maximize efficiency for users and ease of navigation.

* CRUD Actions to Back-end: After setting up the necessary files and forms, I tested each feature with API requests.

* Debug: I approached this project with a mindset of constantly making small changes and immediately testing those changes.

* Styling: I focused on functionality first and once I felt that I was happy with the amount of user features, I then shifted my focus to styling (only after functionality was solid). I utilized console logs and the React inspection chrome extension to drill into any issues that I ran into.

## Unsolved Problems / Future Iterations
I am planning to further work on styling my components.
